## 🎯 Project Vision

AumCoin restores **Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision** for Bitcoin as programmable electronic cash, built on Litecoin's proven foundation. We've re-enabled all the powerful OP_CODES that were disabled in early Bitcoin, removed artificial scaling limits, and are preparing for the post-quantum cryptography future.

**Why this matters:** Bitcoin was designed with ~200 OP_CODES for rich smart contract capabilities, but most were disabled due to early security concerns. We bring them back, safely.

## ✨ Key Features

### ✅ All Original OP_CODES Enabled
- **15 disabled OP_CODES restored**: CAT, SUBSTR, LEFT, RIGHT, INVERT, AND, OR, XOR, 2MUL, 2DIV, MUL, DIV, MOD, LSHIFT, RSHIFT
- **Full implementations intact**: Code was already there, just blocked
- **Powerful scripting**: Build complex smart contracts and on-chain applications

### ✅ Massive Scalability
- **128 MB blocks** (was 1 MB) - 128x increase
- **No script size limits** - complex contracts welcome
- **10 KB push values** (was 520 bytes) - 20x increase
- **True P2P cash** - thousands of transactions per block

### ✅ Proven Foundation
- **Litecoin 0.6.3c base** - Simple, auditable codebase (~30k lines)
- **Scrypt POW** - ASIC-resistant mining, different from BTC/BSV
- **2.5 minute blocks** - 4x faster than Bitcoin
- **MIT License** - Clean, fork-friendly (unlike BSV)

### 🔄 Post-Quantum Ready (Planned)
- Research phase for PQ cryptography integration
- Hybrid classical + quantum-resistant signatures
- Future-proof against quantum computing threats

## 🚀 What's New in This Fork

### Satoshi Vision Restoration (v0.6.3c-SV)

**Before (Original Litecoin 0.6.3c):**
```cpp
// These OP_CODES were blocked
if (opcode == OP_CAT || opcode == OP_MUL || ...)
    return false; // DISABLED
```

**After (AumCoin):**
```cpp
// All OP_CODES now enabled!
// Full implementations active
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ String manipulation (CAT, SUBSTR, LEFT, RIGHT)
- ✅ Bitwise operations (INVERT, AND, OR, XOR)
- ✅ Full arithmetic (MUL, DIV, MOD, shifts)
- ✅ Complex smart contracts possible
- ✅ On-chain data processing

- **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** - Detailed technical changes and philosophy
- **[TESTING.md](TESTING.md)** - Comprehensive testing guide with examples

## 🧪 Quick Test

Test OP_CAT (string concatenation):
```bash
# Start the client
./aumcoind -testnet

# Create a script with OP_CAT
# Concatenates "Hello" + "World" = "HelloWorld"
# This was impossible in standard Bitcoin/Litecoin!
```

See TESTING.md for 50+ test cases covering all restored OP_CODES.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1**: OP_CODE Restoration ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Phase 2**: Block Size Liberation ✅ COMPLETE
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Rebranding (rename to AumCoin, new genesis)
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Post-Quantum Cryptography (research & implementation)

## 🤔 Why Fork Litecoin Instead of Bitcoin?

1. **Implementations Already Present**: Litecoin 0.6.3c has all OP_CODE implementations intact
2. **Simpler Codebase**: 30k lines vs modern 100k+ - easier to audit and modify
3. **Scrypt POW**: Different mining ecosystem, ASIC-resistant
4. **Faster Blocks**: 2.5 minutes vs 10 minutes
5. **Clean License**: No BSV licensing complications
6. **Proven Stability**: Litecoin's 10+ year track record

## 🎯 Why Not BSV?

BSV has similar goals (restore OP_CODES, big blocks), but:
- ❌ Mixed/unclear licensing
- ❌ Political/legal controversies  
- ❌ Same POW as Bitcoin (SHA-256)
- ❌ Complex modern codebase

AumCoin gives you the **technical benefits without the baggage**.

## 📜 Philosophy: Satoshi's Original Vision

From the Bitcoin whitepaper:
> "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash..."

Original Bitcoin had rich scripting capabilities for:
- ✅ Complex contracts
- ✅ On-chain computation
- ✅ Programmable money
- ✅ Unlimited scaling

These were disabled in 2010 due to early security concerns. Modern understanding shows they can be safe with proper limits (operation counts, value sizes). We restore them with BSV-inspired philosophy but Litecoin's proven foundation.

## 🔒 Security Status

**Phase 1 Critical Hardening: ✅ COMPLETE**
- ✅ Compiler hardening: PIE/ASLR, stack protection, NX stack, RELRO
- ✅ OP_CAT allocation safety: Size checked before concatenation
- ✅ BigNum DOS protection: 4096-bit limit on OP_MUL/DIV/MOD operands
- ✅ Comprehensive security analysis document added

**What's Protected:**
- ✅ 201 operation limit per script (prevents CPU DOS)
- ✅ 10 KB push value limit (prevents memory DOS)
- ✅ 4096-bit BigNum limit (prevents arithmetic DOS)
- ✅ Scrypt POW rate limiting (prevents spam)
- ✅ Standard signature verification (ECDSA secp256k1)

**What's Changed:**
- ⚠️ Larger blocks require more bandwidth/storage (128MB vs 1MB)
- ⚠️ Complex scripts use more CPU for validation
- ⚠️ Arithmetic operations (MUL/DIV/MOD) are computationally expensive

**Phase 2 Roadmap (2-3 months):**
- ⏰ OpenSSL 3.x migration (eliminates 50+ CVEs)
- ⏰ Boost 1.84+ upgrade (current stable)
- ⏰ BerkeleyDB → LevelDB migration (better reliability)
- ⏰ Continuous fuzzing infrastructure
- ⏰ External security audit

**Current Status**: ✅ **TESTNET READY** | ⚠️ **Phase 2 required before mainnet with financial value**
